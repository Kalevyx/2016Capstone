PROJECT TITLE: Maze
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Creates a maze - Capstone 2016
VERSION or DATE: May 10, 2016
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Click 'void main(String[] args)' of Maze class
AUTHORS: @crli
USER INSTRUCTIONS: Use arrow keys to navigate through the maze

This project is a maze the user can navigate through. It synthesizes the use
of Gridworld with inheritance and arrays. I had to research about KeyListener
so the user can use the arrow keys to direct his/her character, and I used other
images I wanted as actors instead of just a rock or a flower.
